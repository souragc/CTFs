k - uncreate a child process

SYNOPSIS
    void unfork(void);

DESCRIPTION
    unfork() undoes the operation performed by fork(2).

RETURN VALUE
    unfork() does not return a value.

ATTRIBUTES
    TODO: thread-safety table

CONFORMING TO
    This call is specific to Linux on CSAW systems, and should not be used in programs intended to be portable. It was introduced in Linux Kernel version 5.3.

BUGS
    Nobody knows precisely what unfork() does; avoid it in portable programs. Or avoid it altogether: use exit(2) instead, if that is what you mean. Do not use unfork().
